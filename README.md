# One To Many Association Demo 01

The university requires a system to manage departments and the students admitted into them. Each department can have multiple students, with a defined maximum limit on how many students can be admitted, but each student belongs to only one department.

The system should track department details such as the department name, head of the department, maximum student capacity, and the list of admitted students.

For each student, the system should store information like the student ID, name, date of admission, and current year of study.

The system must ensure that departments do not exceed their student capacity, allow for adding or removing students, and provide the ability to generate a list of students for each department.
